Write a Fortran subroutine that simulates from a Markov chain given the
transition matrix. Simulate 10^6 observations and compare the 
empirical distribution of states with the equilibrium distribution.
Use a transition matrix

0.7 0.2 0.1
0.1 0.5 0.4
0.1 0.1 0.8

but write the program so that it handles an arbitrary number of states.

Declare real variables as real(kind=dp) with dp a module constant, and
put procedures in a module. If you need the constant pi, define it,
since it is not built in to Fortran. If you need to sort data, write a
subroutine to do so, since it is not built in to Fortran. Note that in
Fortran, random_number is a subroutine and not a function. Note that
all the elements of a character array constructor must have the same
LEN. If you create a procedure that uses recursion, declare it as `recursive`.
The maximum line length is 132 characters.
