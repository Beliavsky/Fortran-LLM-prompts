Write a Fortran subroutine in a module to solve a system of linear 
equations using the conjugate gradient solver and validate it. The 
equations are M * x = b, where M is

 4 -1  0
-1  4 -1
 0 -1  4

and b is [1 2 3]. The L2 norm of residuals should be <= 1.0e-6.

Declare real variables as real(kind=dp) with the module constant dp 
defined as

integer, parameter :: dp = kind(1.0d0)

Use the Fortran intrinsic matmul function. Print the solution x and
verify that it is correct by printing M * x.
